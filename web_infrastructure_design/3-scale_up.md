Additional Infrastructure Elements and Their Purposes

Firewalls

Purpose: Firewalls are security devices (either hardware or software) that filter incoming and outgoing network traffic based on an organization's previously established security policies. At their most basic, firewalls are the barrier between secure internal networks and untrusted external networks such as the Internet. They help prevent unauthorized access to or from private networks and are a fundamental component of network security.

HTTPS

Purpose: HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is used for secure communication over a computer network within a distributed system (like the Internet). HTTPS encrypts the session with Secure Socket Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols. This encryption makes the user's data secure from eavesdropping and tampering, which is crucial for maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of the data exchanged, especially in transactions involving sensitive data (like personal information, login credentials, and payment details).

Monitoring

Purpose: Monitoring is used to continuously observe the performance and health of the infrastructure, allowing for the detection of any potential issues before they become critical. This includes monitoring hardware status, application performance, network traffic, and more. Effective monitoring can help in proactive troubleshooting, capacity planning, and maintaining the overall health of the system.

Data Collection: Monitoring tools collect data through various methods, including agents installed on servers, SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol), log files, and external probes. These tools can aggregate, analyze, and visualize data in real-time or for historical analysis.

Monitoring Web Server QPS (Queries Per Second)
To monitor your web server's QPS, you would typically use a monitoring tool or system that can track and report on the number of requests that the server handles per second. This can be achieved by:

Using Monitoring Agents: Install agents on your web servers that can collect and send metrics to a central monitoring solution.

Configuration: Configure the monitoring tool to specifically track and alert based on the QPS metric. This might involve setting up custom dashboards or alerts.

Analysis: Use the collected data to understand traffic patterns, identify potential bottlenecks, and plan for scaling.
Issues with the Infrastructure

SSL Termination at the Load Balancer

Issue: SSL termination at the load balancer means that the encrypted traffic from the client is decrypted at the load balancer and then sent to the web servers in plain text. This can create a security risk if the internal network is not secure, as the unencrypted data might be intercepted within the network.

Mitigation: Ensure that the internal network is secure. Alternatively, consider using SSL pass-through or re-encryption from the load balancer to the servers for sensitive applications.

Single MySQL Server for Writes

Issue: Having only one MySQL server that can accept write operations is a significant single point of failure. If this server goes down, it can halt all write operations, impacting the application's availability and data integrity.

Mitigation: Implement a high-availability solution like MySQL replication with a failover mechanism or use a clustered database system that supports multiple write nodes.
Homogeneous Server Configuration

Issue: Servers with the same components (database, web server, and application server) can lead to inefficient resource utilization and potential performance bottlenecks. For instance, database operations might require more memory and storage, while web and application servers might benefit more from CPU and network resources. Mixing these on the same server can prevent each component from being optimized for its workload.

Mitigation: Use dedicated servers for each component or leverage containerization and virtualization to isolate and optimize resources for each type of workload. This approach improves performance, scalability, and availability.

Conclusion
Understanding the role and purpose of each infrastructure component, along with addressing potential issues, is crucial for designing and maintaining a resilient, secure, and efficient system. Implementing best practices for security, scalability, and monitoring ensures that the infrastructure can support the application's needs while minimizing risks and downtime.
