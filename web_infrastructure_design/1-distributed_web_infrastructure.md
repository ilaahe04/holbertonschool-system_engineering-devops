Additional Infrastructure Elements and Their Purposes

1. Load Balancer
A load balancer is added to distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server bears too much load. This improves the reliability, availability, and scalability of the application.

- Distribution Algorithm: Common algorithms include Round Robin, Least Connections, and IP Hash.
  - Round Robin distributes requests sequentially among the servers in the pool. It's simple and effective for sessions that do not require sticky sessions.
  - Least Connections directs traffic to the server with the fewest active connections. It's more intelligent, taking server load into consideration.
  - IP Hash assigns a unique hash key based on the user's IP address, ensuring a user consistently reaches the same server, beneficial for session persistence.

2. Active-Active vs. Active-Passive Load Balancer Setup
- Active-Active: All load balancers are in use, distributing client requests. This setup maximizes resource utilization and provides high availability as traffic can be rerouted to other active nodes in case of a failure.
- Active-Passive: One load balancer is active, and the other is on standby. The passive load balancer only comes into play if the active one fails. This setup ensures a backup is available but doesn't utilize all resources under normal operations.

The choice between Active-Active and Active-Passive setups depends on the required availability, cost, and complexity of implementation.

3. Database Primary-Replica Cluster
In a Primary-Replica (formerly known as Master-Slave) setup, the Primary node accepts both read and write operations, while Replica nodes replicate the Primary to have the same data through log shipping, streaming replication, or other methods. Replicas can handle read operations to distribute the load.

- Difference Between Primary and Replica Nodes for the Application:
  - Primary Node:Handles all write operations and some or all read operations. It's the source of truth for the latest data.
  - Replica Nodes: Primarily handle read operations to offload the Primary and improve read scalability. Replicas can't accept write operations under normal configurations.

Issues with the Infrastructure

Single Points of Failure (SPOF)
- SPOFs can exist if there's only one instance of a critical component (e.g., a single database server, a single load balancer in an Active-Passive setup without a secondary passive unit ready, or critical application components not replicated).
- Mitigation: Implement redundancy across all layers (e.g., multiple load balancers in an Active-Active setup, database clustering with failover mechanisms).

 Security Issues
- No Firewall: Without a firewall, the infrastructure is vulnerable to unauthorized access and potential attacks.
- No HTTPS: Without HTTPS, data transferred between the client and server is not encrypted, making it susceptible to interception and tampering.
- Mitigation: Implement firewalls to control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on security rules, and use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit, protecting against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

No Monitoring
Without monitoring, there's no way to detect performance bottlenecks, potential security breaches, or system failures in real-time. This lack of insight can delay response times to issues, affecting user experience and potentially leading to data loss or downtime.

- Mitigation: Implement monitoring tools and services to continuously monitor system health, performance metrics, and security logs. This enables proactive management of the infrastructure, ensuring issues can be identified and addressed promptly.

 Conclusion
For a robust web infrastructure, it's crucial to design with redundancy, security, and monitoring in mind. This involves choosing the right load balancing strategy, ensuring high availability through Active-Active or Active-Passive setups as required, implementing a resilient database architecture, securing the data in transit and at rest, and adopting comprehensive monitoring to detect and respond to issues swiftly.
